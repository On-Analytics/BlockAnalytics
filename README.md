# Block Analytics

We will describe key concepts and use the DUNE API to retrieve data related to fundamental metrics, such as block size and block time. 
This provides an excellent way to familiarize yourself with a blockchain and start working with on-chain data. The data presented in this
notebook can be found in many places, but we believe that learning by doing is an excellent approach to begin, and putting things in context is important for analyzing data.
